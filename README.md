# Study project: Mesto

**A service similar to Instagram for sharing photos.**

**Web application features:**
- Change avatar, name, and personal information
- Add new photo cards and view them in full size in the viewer mode

**Web application limitations:**
  - The application is created as part of a course, and access is only available to members of a specific group
  - The profile displays a limited number of cards â€“ 30
  - Photos cannot be uploaded from a device; cards are added via links
